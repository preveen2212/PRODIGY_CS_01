# Caesar Cipher Project

This project implements a basic Caesar Cipher in Python. The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Features

- Encrypts plaintext using a specified key.
- Decrypts ciphertext using a specified key.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Preserves spaces and non-alphabet characters.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/caesar-cipher.git
    cd caesar-cipher
    ```

2. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python caesar_cipher.py
    ```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to either encrypt or decrypt a message.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the program:

```plaintext
### Caesar Cipher Program ###
Do you want to Encrypt or Decrypt?
e/d: e

Encryption Mode Selected

Enter any key value from 1 to 26: 3
Enter the text to Encrypt: hello world
CIPHERTEXT: khoor zruog
